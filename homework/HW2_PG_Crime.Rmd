title: "HW2 Prince George's County Crime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset reporting the number of crimes by month in Prince George's County, Maryland, for every month in 2024. 

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse

You will need to load the tidyverse library

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_crime_totals_2024.csv. You will create a dataframe called `pg_crime` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data and Describe It

```{r}

pg_crime <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/pg_crime_totals_2024.csv")

```
### Task 3: Describe the Data

You should examine that dataframe carefully by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the categories of incidents. From a reporting standpoint, are any of the categories more important than others? Why or why not? Do any of them make the job of summarizing the data more difficult? Why or why not?

ANSWER HERE

The data is pretty consistent, but you could point out certain out liars, such as robbery vehicles jumping from 42 to 16 the next month.  There has also been an upward trend in theft over the year.

### Task 4: Calculating Averages

Calculate the total number of incidents per month for each category using `mutate()`, calling the new column `total_incidents`. Then calculate the average number of incidents per month for each category of crime, calling the new column `average_incidents`. Assign the result to a new dataframe called `pg_crime_averages`.

```{r}

pg_crime <- pg_crime %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    total = sum(c_across(Jan:Dec), na.rm = TRUE),   # Sum up monthly data
    average = mean(c_across(Jan:Dec), na.rm = TRUE) # Calculate average
  )

```

### Task 5: Describe the Averages

Examine the new dataframe, `pg_crime_averages`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the average number of incidents per month for each category. Which categories have the highest average number of incidents per month? Which have the lowest? What does this tell you about the pattern of crime in Prince George's County? Are there categories that you have questions about? Why or why not?

ANSWER HERE

The highest averages are Auto Stolens and Accidents, while the lowest are Homocides and Residential Robberies. The months have been higher than the average for many of the categories, such as 6/7 last months of Theft from Auto.

### Task 6: Testing a Theory

One theory about crime is that it is more likely to occur in the summer months. Test this theory by creating three new columns using `mutate()` that calculate the percentage change compared to the average for each category of crime for the months of June, July, and August. Call the new columns `june_change`, `july_change`, and `august_change`. Assign the result to a new dataframe called `summer_crime_averages`.

```{r}

pg_crime <- pg_crime %>%
  mutate(
    june_change = ((Jun - average) / average) * 100,
    july_change = ((Jul - average) / average) * 100,
    august_change = ((Aug - average) / average) * 100
  )

```

### Task 7: Describe the Summer Crime Averages

Look at the `summer_crime_averages` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change in the average number of incidents per month for each category of crime for the months of June, July, and August. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about the theory that crime is more likely to occur in the summer months?

Theft from Auto and Robbery Other are higher during the summer months, but categories like homicide

### Task 8: What's the Story?

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story focused on the crime data in Prince George's County. It could be from any of the dataframes you've created in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

ANSWER HERE

Prince Georgeâ€™s County shows spike in theft-related crimes during the summer of 2024.

Notable crime categories like "THEFT FROM AUTO" and "ROBBERY OTHER" showed significant increases during the summer months. Violent crimes such as "HOMICIDE" remained consistent throughout the year. These findings can help decipher needs for targeted public safety measures during peak crime months.

### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
