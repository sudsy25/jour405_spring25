title: "HW4 MD CityCrime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv")
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities %>%
  mutate(
    violent_rate_2019 = (violent2019 / pop2019) * 100000,
    property_rate_2019 = (property2019 / pop2019) * 100000,
    violent_rate_2020 = (violent2020 / pop2020) * 100000,
    property_rate_2020 = (property2020 / pop2020) * 100000)
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

ANSWER HERE

Ocean City and Baltimore City swap top spots for violent crime rates in 2019 and 2020, but Ocean City remains up top for property crime rates in both years. Property crimes in PG County jumped from 2019-2020, with Colmar Manor and Landover Hills jumping into the top 3.

### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates %>%
  mutate(
    violent_change = ((violent_rate_2020 - violent_rate_2019) / violent_rate_2019) * 100,
    property_change = ((property_rate_2020 - property_rate_2019) / property_rate_2019) * 100)
```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

ANSWER HERE

Edmonston had the greatest violent change with a 900% increase.  Frederick had great overall change dropping 95% in violent crimes and 90% in property crimes. I think the outliers are interesting, but some of the "inf" changes may come from a small city going from 0 to 2 crimes.

### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

ANSWER HERE

Ocean City ranked among the highest violent and property crime rates in Maryland for both 2019 and 2020, while Frederick County saw a dramatic decrease of over 90% in both categories, according to newly released crime data.

Crime data from Maryland cities reveals that Ocean City consistently ranked highest in both violent and property crime rates over the two-year period, with Baltimore City being the only close competitor. The popular beach town’s crime rate remained significantly high, potentially due to large number of tourists, nightlife, and law enforcement priorities. Meanwhile, Frederick County recorded a remarkable drop in crime, with both violent and property crime rates dropping by over 90% between 2019 and 2020. This contrast could have a multitude of reasons behind it, including policies, community engagement, and external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic on crime trends across Maryland.

### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.

### Task 10:

```{r}
md_cities_percentiles <- md_cities_rates %>%
  mutate(percentile = ntile(violent_rate_2020, 100))
```

```{r}
iqr_values <- md_cities_rates %>%
  summarize(IQR = IQR(violent_rate_2020))
```

Ocean City still remains at the top, with other cities not too far behing in the percentile range. This new data does not change my best story idea, as the contrast between Ocean City’s crime issues and Frederick’s decline remains the most newsworthy aspect.
